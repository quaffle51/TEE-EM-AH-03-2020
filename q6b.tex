We are told that:
\begin{quote}
	It is required to reduce the size of the tumour from $C_0$ at $t = 0$ to $C_1$ at
	$t = t_1$. Let $x_0$ = $\log(C_0/\Cmax)$ and $x_1 = \log(C_1/\Cmax)$. For the health of the
	patient, it is desired to minimise the total amount of drug administered,
	which is given by the functional
	\[
		S[D] = \Int{0}{t_1}{t}\,D(t).
	\]
\end{quote}
So, by expressing $D$ in terms of $x$ and $\dot{x}=\dd x/\dd t$ it should be possible to show that $S[D]$ may be written as
\[
	S[x] = -\Int{0}{t_1}{t}\,\frac{\dot{x} + x}{1 + \dot{x} + x}.
\]
From part~(a)
\begin{align*}
	{}&\dot{x}     = -x - \frac{D}{1+D},\\
	{}&\dot{x} + x = - \frac{D}{1+D},\\
	{}&(\dot{x} + x)(1+D) = -D,\\
	{}& (\dot{x} + x) + D(\dot{x} + x) = -D,\\
	{}& D(\dot{x} + x) + D = -(\dot{x} + x),\\
	{}& D(\dot{x} + x + 1) = -\dot{x} - x,\\
	{}& D = \frac{-\dot{x} - x}{\dot{x} + x + 1}\,\,.
\end{align*}
So
\[
	S[x] = -\Int{0}{t_1}{t}\,\frac{\dot{x} + x}{\dot{x} + x + 1}\qquad\textrm{as required.}
\]
